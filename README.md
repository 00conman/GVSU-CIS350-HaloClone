# Team Professorson

This project will focus on creating a 'simple' roguelike-style game that forces me to learn [BearLibTerminal](http://foo.wyrd.name/en:bearlibterminal) and [Tracery](http://tracery.io/).  It will shake the world with its simpilicity and prototypical nature.

THIS IS MY UPDATE. CLASS ENDS IN 5 MINUTES.  have a good evening.  creativity is waning :(.
